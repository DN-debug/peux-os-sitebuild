This is definitely not going to be a long post. Just want to inform everyone that Calamares now contains the fix to the autologin issue. However, if you opt for it, then the changes made to the login screen would no longer be visible, innit? Feel free to test it in the upcoming versions/builds. 



Enjoy!
