In most cases, laptop's touchpad should work. However, if it doesn't, then it means the "libinput" settings are not working properly.

In most scenarios, peope would ask you to create a synaptic.conf file. Honestly speaking, if libinput is present, you don't really have to create any additional configuration files. The settings are present, and you just need to find a way to enable it. Follow the procedures below:

For XFCE:

1.  Enter XFCE Settings.
2.  Select the Mouse and Touchpad settings.
3.  If necessary, select your Touchpad device.
4.  In the General section, enable "Tap touchpad to click"

For LXQt:

1.  Settings, then go to Keyboard and Mouse.
2.  You should be able to see "Mouse and Touchpad" option of the left side column. You can enable it from there.

For Gnome:

1.  Settings, then go to "Mouse and Touchpad".
2.  Enable "tap to click"
