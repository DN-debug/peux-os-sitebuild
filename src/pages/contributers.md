A **pantheon** is a group of important and respected people. Out of respect, this page is dedicated to them, for willingly contributing to the Peux OS project, in one way or the other. I never thought that this project would gain so much exposure. The aim has always been: stick with Archlinux philosophy while implementing modern desktop ideas and that being the sole reason for not having a custom repository for Peux OS. The release cycle is also a bit weird which I'll explain in a blog post.

Below is the list of contributors:

> **WALL OF FAME**
>
> ***\[Given to Patrons and BuyMeACoffee supporters for their contribution to FOSS Donations]***

*   Modo -- My first patron and the person who initially saw the "sincerity and uniqueness" in this project.

> **PILLARS**
>
> ***\[Given to testers, proposers, reviewers]***

*   FossTorrents -- My first partnership was with FossTorrent guys. They provided a free torrent hosting platform and refurbished the Peux Logo as a support to the project.
*   Tyler'sTech -- A popular YouTuber in our "Linux Community". He reviewed the project and created an extraordinary audience for it.
*   dangeruss26 -- An active Twister OS tester.  Willingly participated in testing the Peux OS to make it much better. He tested it on different machines, which helped in identifying hardware issues. He'll be participating in a lot more upcoming tests.
*   Anthony -- Still a school-kid and probably the youngest among us but the desire to contribute to FOSS is overwhelming. You'll most likely see the wallpapers contributed by him in the next release.

This list will grow eventually as the number of contributors would rise. My teacher used to tell me that " not everybody would like your work, but cherish those who will and never let it go ". I'd give myself some credit as well for changing it from a hobby project to partial-hobby project ( I'm nothing but generous :D )

Thank you for reading!
