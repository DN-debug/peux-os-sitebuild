POS was initially a customized arch for personal use, and we went with the flow of creating and changing configuratons. That's how we created this distro.  ;)

Initially it was named as Pentux OS and then changed to Peux OS.

**Why did we change the name?**

The idea behind **Pentux** was Linux Logo : Penguin with a Tux.

Well, Pentux, as a name, already exists on the internet. So we don't want copyright issues. We then dropped the "T", changing it to Penux. However, the definition in Urban Dictonary states "The metaphorical size of an advanced Linux user's penis after showing dominance by correcting a Linux beginner's statement."

We certainly don't want that name but neither did we want to drop the POS abbreviation. So there comes the French word "Peux", means "can". We never though can and but we did created a distro that's both beautiful and lightweight, it includes the best of our personal configurations.

Our goal is to stick to the base-system, that is Arch linux, while implementing the modern desktop ideas into it.
