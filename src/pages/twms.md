          i3wm is considered to be the most popular in the TWM family. Peux OS
          i3wm is actually using i3-gaps, which is a fork of the original i3wm
          with gapping between the tiled windows.

          Bspwm is another amazing tiling window manager that represents windows
          as the leaves of a full binary tree. Peux OS Bspwm comes with similar
          rich features that one would find on Peux i3wm flavor.
