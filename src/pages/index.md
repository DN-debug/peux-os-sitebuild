          POS uses customized XFCE as its default-version. BTRFS is the default
          filesystem with autosnap enabled. It uses Polybar as its default
          panel. Aiming to have a minimal desktop and yet beautiful.

      - title: Beautiful yet Secure
        content: >+
          POS doesn't only look good. Its tied with apps that will help you
          secure your data and privacy. You can sandbox your applications, do
          anonymous surfing among many other things.

          OH! btw "FISH" is the default shell.

          PACMAN is the default cli package manager along with pamac as an
          alternative. For GUI, use Pamac-Manager, with Flatpak and AUR support
          options in its settings.

      ***Peux OS*** comes with three different desktop flavors: XFCE, LXQt and
      Gnome. XFCE is the flagship. Out of these three versions, LXQt and XFCE
      are both highly configured. Gnome is included because of its minimalism
      and stability. This project will improve with time.


      **Note: All the downloads are now moved to stable branch. The aim is to
      keep it minimal rather than lightweight. You can download Peux OS from any
      of the below available sites.**

      **Communication** - is the key, ain't it?  Even if you don't like Peux OS,
      you can still talk to me because I'm sure even if you disagree, you won't
      hate me as a person ;)


      I am not great in conversations, but I learnt as much as possible from
      conversations that I've had with people over the years. Below are the
      links, let's have a lil' chit-chat.
