A **pantheon** is a group of important and respected people. Out of respect, this page is dedicated to them, for willingly contributing to the Peux OS project, in one way or the other. I never thought that this project would gain so much exposure. The aim has always been: stick with Archlinux philosophy while implementing modern desktop ideas and that being the sole reason for not having a custom repository for Peux OS. The release cycle is also a bit weird which I'll explain in a blog post.

Below is the list of contributors:

> **WALL OF FAME**
>
> ***\[Given to Patrons and BuyMeACoffee supporters for their contribution to FOSS Donations]***

*   Modo -- My first patron and the person who initially saw the "sincerity and uniqueness" in this project.

> **PILLARS**
>
> ***\[Given to testers, proposers, reviewers]***

*   XFCENation -- They usually spread anything related to XFCE. It was just released and these guys helped spreading it across their fanbase. They also introduced this project to FossTorrents.
*   FossTorrents -- My first partnership was with the FossTorrent guys. They provided a free torrent hosting platform and refurbished the Peux Logo as a support to the project.
*   Tyler'sTech -- A popular YouTuber in our "Linux Community". He came to know about this project through DistroWatch and his unbiased review of the project has reached an extraordinary audience.
*   Russ ( aka dangeruss26 ) -- An active Twister OS tester.  Willingly participated in testing Peux OS to make it much better. He tested it on different machines, which helped in identifying hardware issues. He'll be participating in a lot more upcoming tests.
*   Anthony ( aka Connor ) -- Still a school-kid and probably the youngest among us but the desire to contribute to FOSS is overwhelming. You'll most likely see the wallpapers contributed by him in the next release.
*   Yan ( aka Purple Scientist ) -- Our scientist friend here has also contributed to the wallpaper list. He even suggested keeping a nice cute logo for our Discord Server along with some suggestions on using Papirus ( I chose to keep it after collecting votes from everyone ) and more dark themes.
*   Geo ( aka Eborn ) -- Ex Reborn OS tester. An expert in Virtualization/ParaVirtualization. He is running the hardware and performance tests along with "dangeruss26" these days, aiming to improve the performance on different machines.

This list will grow eventually as the number of contributors would rise. My teacher used to tell me that " not everybody would like your work, but cherish those who will and never let it go ". I'd give myself some credit as well for changing it from a hobby project to a partial-hobby project ( I'm nothing but generous :D )

Thank you!
