Hi All,

I am planning to release some of the Wayland Compositor ISOs. Even though the ISOs are **Stable**, I am still releasing them under **Beta** tag. I am still part of the crowd that heavily believes Wayland to be overestimated and that it still needs a lot of work. However, the progress has been great over the last couple of years. The sole reason behind releasing these as Beta is due to the belief mentioned above and I am sure that on most machines it may cause problems, especially the ones with Nvidia graphics card.

Please also note that I am deciding not to put the Beta versions on FOSSTorrents, as it'd be easy for me to take down the ISOs or upload a new one to test whenever I wish to, once the stability is confirmed, the stable ones would be available on FOSSTorrents. The maintainer does a lot of work which is house related, his own job while maintaining the FOSSTorrents site, which is why I don't want to bother him with back to back beta-releases.

Any inputs/feedback/adjustments/advices related to Beta are warmly welcomed. Let me know via Discord/Telegram/SourceForge, you may also drop a message to me on Twitter, if you wish to.

Have a great day!

Dev
