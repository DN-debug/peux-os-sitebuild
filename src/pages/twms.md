          i3wm is considered to be the most popular in the TWM family. Peux OS
          i3wm is actually using i3-gaps, which is a fork of the original i3wm
          with gapping between the tiled windows.

          Bspwm is another amazing tiling window manager that represents windows
          as the leaves of a full binary tree. Peux OS Bspwm comes with similar
          rich features that one would find on Peux i3wm flavor.

          Xmonad is not just another tiling window manager, it stands out
          because of its extensibility. It is written and configured in Haskell
          which means you can extend the libraries to adjust your requirements.
