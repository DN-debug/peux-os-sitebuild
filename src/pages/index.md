        content: >+
          POS uses customized XFCE as its default-version. BTRFS is the default
          filesystem with autosnap enabled. It uses Polybar as its default
          panel. Aiming to have a minimal desktop and yet beautiful.

      - title: Beautiful yet Secure
        content: >
          POS doesn't only look good. It is tied with apps that will help you
          secure your data and privacy. You can sandbox your applications, do
          anonymous surfing among many other things.

          OH! btw "FISH" is the default shell.
      - title: Apps & Packages
        content: >
          PACMAN is the default CLI package manager along with yay as an
          alternative. For GUI, we have replaced the Pamac-Manager with Bauh
          (ba-oo) as the one-stop-shop for all types of packages.

      ***Peux OS*** comes with four different desktop flavors: XFCE, LXQt,
      Gnome, and KDE. XFCE is the flagship. Out of these four versions: KDE,
      LXQt, and XFCE are the highly configured ones. Gnome has been included
      because of its minimalism and stability.


      Please note that if you are using UnetBootin/Etcher, then the boot process
      is likely going to fail. To make a bootable USB, use Rufus-dd mode / dd -
      CLI mode / Multiwriter / Mintstick / Ventoy.


      ***


      \*\*Note: All the older versions of Peux OS would be moved to the archive
      folder within the respective flavor's directory that is present in
      SourceForge. The focus is to keep it minimal rather than lightweight. You
      can download Peux OS from any of the below available sites. This project
      will improve with time.\*\*

      **Communication** - is the key, ain't it?  I am not great at
      conversations, but I learned as much as possible from conversations that
      I've had with people over the years.  That's why I'm pretty sure that we
      can be great friends ;)


      Below are the links, let's have a lil' chit-chat.

    content: >
      Peux OS is free and will always be free. Someone suggested me to keep this
      section because most of the time people don't check the website-footer ( I
      am one of them ).


      This is a choice, if you want to help through donations then by all means
      chip in that money. Any of the buttons below would take you there:
