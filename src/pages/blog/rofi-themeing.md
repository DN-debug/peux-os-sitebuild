Awhile ago, someone reported to have confronted with an unusual Rofi issue.  They did a system upgrade and that's when the themeing issue on Rofi started to appear. I am not exactly sure about the component that has caused this as I have not yet delved into it. I've faced this issue while upgrating the TWM ISOs, but didn't think that this would affect the existing themes as well.

Neverthless, I have already fixed it. Please use the below repo, copy the contents of XFCE folder over to ~/.config/rofi.
