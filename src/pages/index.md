        content: >+
          POS uses customized lightweight XFCE as its session-manager. It
          doesn't implement XFCE panel, rather Polybar and Tint2 as its default
          panel. The resulting product is a beautiful GUI.

        content: >+
          POS doesn't only look good. We tied it with apps that will help you
          secure your data and privacy.


          OH! btw "FISH" is the default shell.

          PACMAN is the default cli package manager along with yay and pamac as
          alternatives. For GUI, you may also use Pamac-Manager, along with
