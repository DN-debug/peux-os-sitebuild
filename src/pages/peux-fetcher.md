      Peux Fetcher serves the purpose of the Peux OS mantra, i.e stick with
      Archlinux as much as possible, which being the sole reason for not
      maintaining a repository. I did mention that we would be delivering the
      configurations via Github repositories. Peux Fetcher would allow you to,
      not only fetch the configurations but also to read the code on Github as
      it is all public. In the upcoming releases, it'd be pre-installed, those
      who are in the previous builds can download the package in any of the
      below formats \[ we have Debian format as well because few might want to
      fetch the configurations on Debian systems as well, and I see no harm in
      keeping an additional format ].
