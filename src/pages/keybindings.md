      The below keybindings are only specific to BSPWM.  Only important
      keybindings are included, few of the keybindings would require you to
      explore the configuration further. The general purpose keybindings i.e for
      launching applications or menus are not included here.

      The below keybindings are only specific to LEFTWM. Only the important
      keybindings are included, few of the keybindings would require you to
      explore the configuration further. The general purpose keybindings i.e for
      launching applications or menus are not included here.


      Note: LeftWM is pretty new in comparison to the rest of the TWMs, so you
      might see some weirdness within the environment, but since it has a huge
      potential that's why I don't think that including it is a mistake. Give it
      a go.
