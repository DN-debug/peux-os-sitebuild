      keybindings are included, few of the keybindings would require you to
      explore the configuration further. The general purpose keybindings i.e for
      launching applications or menus are not included here.


      Note: LeftWM is pretty new in comparison to the rest of the TWMs, so you
      might see some weirdness within the environment, but since it has a huge
      potential that's why I don't think that including it is a mistake. Give it
      a go.
