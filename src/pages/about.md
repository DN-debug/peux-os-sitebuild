POS was initially a customized arch for personal use only. Initially it was named as Pentux OS and then was changed to Peux OS as the initial name already exists on the internet. 

Peux represents the linux "Penguin with a tux".

**AIM**

Honestly speaking, it's just a hobby. However, the goal is to stick to the base-system, that is Arch linux, while implementing the modern desktop ideas into it.  Initially, I thought to create a standalone OS of its own nature and own package manager, however creating a huge repository is not an easy task. Besides, Arch has such a wonderful community that made it easy for me.

Bitter truth is that you'll find many arch-based distros out there. 
Then why Peux OS? Well, it's a proof that community driven ideas and already existing tools can make the experience so much better. 

Remember : it's part of hobby and learning procedure. But you are most welcome to lend me a hand.
