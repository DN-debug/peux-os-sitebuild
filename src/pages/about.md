POS was initially a customized arch for personal use, later the idea of converting it into a distro came. Initially was named as Pentux OS and then to Peux OS.

**Why did we change the name?**

The idea behind **Pentux** was Linux Logo : Penguin with a Tux.

Well, Pentux, as a name, already exists on the internet. So we don't want copyright issues. We then dropped the "T", changing it to Penux. However, the definition in Urban Dictonary states "The metaphorical size of an advanced Linux user's penis after showing dominance by correcting a Linux beginner's statement."

We certainly don't want that name but neither did we want to drop the POS abbreviation. So there comes the French word "Peux", means "can". We can and we did make a distro that's both beautiful and lightweight, includes the best of our personal configurations.

Our goal is to stick to the base-system, that is Arch linux's principles to keep it simple but also, to bring in the modern desktop ideas into it.
