      For anyone, who would like to use the configuration used in Peux OS, feel
      free to clone/fork/download the contents from the common repository :
      [peux-dotfiles](https://github.com/peux-os-sic)


      Those who have Peux Fetcher installed, can pull the configuration
      directly.


      Please note that in some cases, these could contain uncleaned
      configurations as well { mostly true for BETA releases, since I have not
      included all the features yet }. Still feel free to make/open
      Suggestions/PRs directly from the respective repository.


      \[ Since we do not have a decent number of crowd to test 'Peux Fetcher'
      app, it is currently in **unmaintained** status ]
