POS was initially a customized arch for personal use, and we went with the flow of creating and changing configuratons. That's how we created this distro.  ;)

Initially it was named as Pentux OS and then changed to Peux OS.

**Why did we change the name?**

The idea behind **Pentux** was Linux Logo : Penguin with a Tux.

Well, Pentux, as a name, already exists on the internet. So we don't want copyright issues. We then dropped the "T", changing it to Penux. However, the definition in Urban Dictonary states "The metaphorical size of an advanced Linux user's penis after showing dominance by correcting a Linux beginner's statement."

We certainly don't want that name but neither did we want to drop the POS abbreviation. So there comes the French word "Peux", means "can". We never though can and but we did created a distro that's both beautiful and lightweight, it includes the best of our personal configurations.


**TEAM**

Well, it's a single person team. I am a network-engineer by profession. The reason, I used "We" in all my statements is because every single piece of work implemented in this OS is taken from Community. 

I'd love if someone just shows up and say to me : "can we also contribute in this OS, actively".


**AIM**

Our goal is to stick to the base-system, that is Arch linux, while implementing the modern desktop ideas into it.  Initially, thought to create a standalone OS of its own nature, however creating a huge repository is not an easy task. Besides, Arch has such a wonderful community that made it easy for me.

There's hardly any arch-distro that does it differently. Bitter truth is that you'll find many arch-based distros out there. 
Then why Peux OS? Well, it's a proof that community driven ideas can make the experience so much better. 

Try it!
