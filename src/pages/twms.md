          I am not good at naming things, but every name that I give has an
          explanation behind it. B-IX has three tiling window managers. The
          default is window manager is Bspwm and the other two are i3-gaps and
          Xmonad, which are completely optional. What's different? These TWMs
          are bundled together in one single release. You generally see
          different releases for different versions in other distros. The idea
          here is to collate all-in-one and let the user select the options that
          comes after the hyphen. 


          Name breakdown : B-IX - has a hyphen between B and IX, suggesting that
          whatever comes to the left-side of the hyphen is default and to the
          right-side is optional. If I ever add other TWMs in this bundle, then
          they would come after the hyphen.
