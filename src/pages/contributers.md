A **pantheon** is a group of important and respected people. This page is dedicated to them, for willingly contributing to the Peux OS project. I never thought that this project would gain so much exposure. The aim has always been simple: stick with Archlinux philosophy while implementing modern desktop ideas and that being the sole reason for not having a custom repository for Peux OS. The release cycle is also a bit weird because I always go outside of the predefined ways of implementation.

*   Modo -- My first patron and the person who initially saw the "sincerity and uniqueness" in this project.

> **PILLARS**

> ***\[Given to testers, proposers, reviewers]***

*   FossTorrents -- My first partnership was with FossTorrent guys. They provided a free torrent hosting platform and refurbished the Peux Logo as a support to the project.
*   Tyler'sTech -- A popular YouTuber in our "Linux Community". He reviewed the project and created an extraordinary audience for it.
*   dangeruss26 -- An active Twister OS tester.  Willingly participated in testing the Peux OS to make it much better. He tested it on different machines, which helped in identifying hardware issues. He'll be participating in a lot more upcoming tests.
*   Anthony -- Still a school-kid and youngest among us ( probably, I didn't ask his age ) but the desire to contribute to FOSS is overwhelming. You'll most likely see the wallpapers contributed by him in the next release.

This list will grow eventually as the number of contributors would rise. Even though there would be times when few may like Peux OS and few may not, but what's important is to keep it going. Remember it started as a hobby, and you guys just made it a partial-hobby of mine ( giving some credits to myself by being generous :P ).

Thank you!
