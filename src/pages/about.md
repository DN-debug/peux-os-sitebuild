Peux OS was initially a customized arch for my personal use only. It was never really an idea to convert it into a distro.  COVID-19 boredom made it possible.

Peux represents the linux "Penguin with a tux".

**AIM**

Honestly speaking, it's just a hobby. However, the goal is to stick to the base-system, that is Arch linux, while implementing the modern desktop ideas into it.  Initially, I thought that I'd create a standalone OS of its own nature and own package manager, however creating a huge repository is not an easy task for a lazy-bum like me. Besides, Arch has such a wonderful community that made it easy for me to create this spin-off.

Bitter truth is that you'll find many arch-based distros out there. Then why Peux OS? Well, it's a proof that community driven ideas and already existing tools can make the experience so much better. Further tweaks can make it more than better.

Remember : I am doing this as a hobby but can't say otherwise.
