Ratpoison is often considered as the 'King of WMs', modelled after GNU screen. If you would like to use a window manager which is keyboard-centric and you wouldn't have to rely on the mouse, then Ratpoison is the right choice. It has no fancy decorations and its beyond minimalistic approach is its greatest strength.

The way to use Ratpoison is very simple, it uses EMACS notations for keyboard controls. The default modifier usually is 'C-t', however in case of Peux OS Ratpoison, it is 'Super_L'.  Once you press 'Super_L', wait for the cursor to change its shape like a box, which hints that you can now use the sequence key to perform the tasks specified in your Ratpoison's configuration, located in your home directory \[ ~/.ratpoisonrc ]. 

For example, to list the available keybindings, use 'Super_L', wait for pointer to change to a box, then press '?'. You will get to see the list of available keybindings.
