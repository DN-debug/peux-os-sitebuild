Privacy is a **big** necessity in today's day to day life. Productivity in simple sentence would be to calculate the amount of job/task we've done or given our efforts into, for a certain period of time.

Now, privacy does play its role in productivity (in terms of digital world). So you might want to look into certain tools, created specifically to boost the productivity while maintaining the end-user's privacy.

Below are the tools/platforms that I'm aware of and these can help you exceedingly.

1. **Write.as**

This is for people interested in writing. This let's your write your stories, blogs and much more without sacrificing the privacy. You can do it anonymously as well, i.e without signing up. Even if you signup, you don't necessarily have to provide your email-address. Totally privacy-oriented, a cross-platform for writing.
