Peux OS was initially a customized arch for my personal use only. It was never really an idea to convert it into a distro.  COVID-19 boredom made it possible.

Peux represents the Linux "Penguin with a tux". I know that most of you would pronounce it in French, but its pronunciation is "PayUx" or "PeyUx" whichever suits you better \[ 'Pe' from Penguin and 'Ux' from Tux/Linux ].

**AIM**

Honestly speaking, it's just a hobby. However, the goal is to stick to the base system, that is Arch Linux while implementing the modern desktop ideas into it.  Initially, I thought that I'd create a standalone OS of its own nature and own package manager, however, creating a huge repository is not an easy task for a lazy bum like me and it takes a lot of effort to achieve that goal too. 

Bitter truth is that you'll find many arch-based distros out there. Then why Peux OS? Well, its proof is that community-driven ideas and already existing tools can make the experience so much better. Further tweaks can make it more than better.

Remember: I am doing this as a hobby but can't say otherwise, i.e I'll continue to make changes to this distro and improvise it as the project will continue to grow.

I'd say, if you like it then spread the word, give some suggestions by either creating a thread on SourceForge under the discussion tab or join me on Discord/Telegram to have a lil' chit-chat if you want. I am also available at the Twitter handle - @whiteyakuzaa.

Enjoy!
