A **pantheon** is a group of important and respected people. Out of respect, this page is dedicated to them, for willingly contributing to the Peux OS project, in one way or the other. I never thought that this project would gain so much exposure. The aim has always been: stick with Archlinux philosophy while implementing modern desktop ideas and that being the sole reason for not having a custom repository for Peux OS. The release cycle is also a bit weird which I'll explain in a blog post.

Below is the list of contributors:

> **WALL OF FAME**
>
> ***\[Given to Patrons/BuyMeACoffee/PayPal supporters for their contribution to FOSS Donations]***

*   Modo -- My first patron and the person who initially saw the "sincerity and uniqueness" in this project.
*   Kevin E -- My first supporter on BMC and the person who made me realize that digital coffee is actually a "thing".
*   Nik Leb -- My first Paypal donation came from Nik. I appreaciate that he stepped up to support the project in his own way.
*   Chase M -- My second Paypal donation came from Chase, who appreciated Peux OS for its immense customization.

> **PILLARS**
>
> ***\[Given to testers, proposers, reviewers]***

*   XFCENation -- They usually spread anything related to XFCE. It was just released and these guys helped to spread it across their fanbase. They also introduced this project to FossTorrents.
*   FossTorrents -- My first partnership was with the FossTorrent guys. They provided a free torrent hosting platform and refurbished the Peux Logo as a support to the project.
*   Tyler'sTech -- A popular YouTuber in our "Linux Community". He came to know about this project through DistroWatch and his unbiased review of the project has reached an extraordinary audience.
*   Distrocrunch ( aka Mike ) -- Distrocrunch is a platform that reviews different Linux/BSD based distros. I found it quite interesting  when I read the review, the details, even though not about everything, was right on spot. Mike helped me realise that on some particular vendor-machines the battery icon is not popping up for the end-users. I have fixed that now and should be visible in the next release.
*   Russ ( aka dangeruss26 ) -- An active Twister OS tester.  Willingly participated in testing Peux OS to make it much better. He tested it on different machines, which helped in identifying hardware issues. He'll be participating in a lot more upcoming tests.
*   Anthony ( aka Connor ) -- Still a school-kid and probably the youngest among us but the desire to contribute to FOSS is overwhelming. You'll most likely see the wallpapers contributed by him in the KDE releases.
*   Yan ( aka Purple Scientist ) -- Our scientist friend here has also contributed to the wallpaper list. He even suggested keeping a nice cute logo for our Discord Server along with some suggestions on using Papirus ( I chose to keep it after collecting votes from everyone ) and more dark themes. His suggestions are included in the KDE version of Peux OS.
*   Geo ( aka Eborn ) -- Ex Reborn OS tester. An expert in Virtualization/ParaVirtualization. He is running the hardware and performance tests along with "dangeruss26" these days, aiming to improve the performance on different machines.
*   りなぶ linux party -- A Japanese Youtuber. He's not that famous, but he covered all of the Peux OS versions that I have published so far. I don't really watch the YouTube videos because of my how busy my work has recently got, however I do hope that he will get some more subscribers on his channel.



This list will grow eventually as the number of contributors would rise. My teacher used to tell me that " not everybody would like your work, but cherish those who will and never let it go ". I'd give myself some credit as well for changing it from a hobby project to a partial-hobby project ( I'm nothing but generous :D )

Thank you!
