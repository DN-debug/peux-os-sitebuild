POS was initially a customized arch for personal use only. Initially it was named as Pentux OS and then was changed to Peux OS.

**Why did we change the name?**

The idea behind **Pentux** was the Linux Logo : Penguin with a Tux.

Well, Pentux, as a name, already exists on the internet. So we don't want copyright issues. We then dropped the "T", changing it to Penux. However, the definition in Urban Dictonary states "The metaphorical size of an advanced Linux user's penis after showing dominance by correcting a Linux beginner's statement."

We certainly don't want that name but neither did we want to drop the POS abbreviation. We then dropped the "N", making it "Peux" - its a french word meaning "can" but for us it is still going to be the short form of "Penguin Tux". 

**TEAM**

Well, it's a single person team. I am a network-engineer by profession. The reason, I used "We" in all of my statements is because every single piece of work implemented in this OS is taken from Community. 

I'd love if someone just shows up and participate alongside.

**AIM**

Honestly speaking, it's just a hobby. However, the goal is to stick to the base-system, that is Arch linux, while implementing the modern desktop ideas into it.  Initially, thought to create a standalone OS of its own nature, however creating a huge repository is not an easy task. Besides, Arch has such a wonderful community that made it easy for me.

Bitter truth is that you'll find many arch-based distros out there. 
Then why Peux OS? Well, it's a proof that community driven ideas and already existing tools can make the experience so much better.
