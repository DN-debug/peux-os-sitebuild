Dev, are you writing this because you have partnership with them? NO. I am writing this because I want like minded guys to come forth and support the FOSS community. 

But isn't there a price to everything? FOSS community survives with the help of **Donations** . Aim of FOSS is directly proportional to its name: Free Open Source Software. It has survived this long because of some generous people.
