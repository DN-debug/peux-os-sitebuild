          POS uses customized lightweight XFCE as its session-manager. It
          doesn't implement XFCE panel, rather Polybar and Tint2 as its default
          panel. The resulting product is a beautiful GUI.

          POS doesn't only look good. We tied it with apps that will help you
          secure your data and privacy.
