        content: >+
          POS uses customized XFCE as its default-version. BTRFS is the default
          filesystem with autosnap enabled. It uses Polybar as its default
          panel. Aiming to have a minimal desktop and yet beautiful.

      - title: Beautiful yet Secure
        content: >
          POS doesn't only look good. It is tied with apps that will help you
          secure your data and privacy. You can sandbox your applications, do
          anonymous surfing among many other things.

          OH! btw "FISH" is the default shell.
      - title: Apps & Packages
        content: >
          PACMAN is the default CLI package manager along with pamac as an
          alternative. For GUI, use Pamac-Manager, with Flatpak and AUR support
          options in its settings.

      ***Peux OS*** comes with three different desktop flavors: XFCE, LXQt and
      Gnome. XFCE is the flagship. Out of these three versions, LXQt and XFCE
      are both highly configured. Gnome is included because of its minimalism
      and stability. This project will improve with time.


      Please note that if you are using UnetBootin/Etcher, then the boot-process
      is likely going to fail. To make a bootable USB, use Rufus-dd mode / dd -
      CLI mode / Multiwriter.


      **Note: All the downloads are now moved to the stable branch. The aim is
      to keep it minimal rather than lightweight. You can download Peux OS from
      any of the below available sites.**

      **Communication** - is the key, ain't it?  I am not great at
      conversations, but I learned as much as possible from conversations that
      I've had with people over the years.  That's why I'm pretty sure that we
      can be great friends ;)

      Peux OS is free and will always be free. It was a suggestion by someone to
      keep this section because most of the time people don't check the footer (
      I fall under the same category ).


      This is not a necessity at all, but if you want to help by donating to the
