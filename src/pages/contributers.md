A **pantheon** of a group of important and respected people. This page is dedicated to them, who willingly contributed to the Peux OS project. I never thought that this project would gain so much exposure. The aim has always been simple: stick with Archlinux philosophy while implementing modern desktop ideas and that being the sole reason for not having a custom repository for Peux OS.

The list below is going to expand with time.
