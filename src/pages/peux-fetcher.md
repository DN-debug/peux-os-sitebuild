      Peux Fetcher serves the purpose of the Peux OS mantra, i.e stick with
      Archlinux as much as possible, which being the sole reason for not
      maintaining a repository. I did mention that we would be delivering the
      configurations via Github repositories. Peux Fetcher would allow you to,
      not only fetch the configurations but also to read the code on Github as
      it is all public. In the upcoming releases, it'd be pre-installed, those
      who are in the previous builds can download the package in any of the
      below formats.


      Note: This is the first version of Peux Fetcher, released as a beta to
      test the crowd and weirdness in the application. The package in itself is
      stable and ready to use. Even we have not discovered any weirdness in the
      application, but over time, only after extensive usage, we would be able
      to uncover the loopholes within the app.


      \[ Since we do not have a decent number of crowd to test this app, this is
      currently in **unmaintained** status ]
